## Metrics

## Objetive
Web App that centralizes functionalities that I use from each app, for example, time tracking, notes and financial records.

Currently, I use many apps that do their job, but it becomes too many subscriptions and apps to manage those tasks.

* Add financial information
* Notes
* Works in the browser of any device

## Non-Goals

## Overview
We need a web application with an interface for splitting modules and saving the different registers.
